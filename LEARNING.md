Iteration 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Position Relative:
  - everything on page is by default static.
  - giving an element position: relative means that it's relative to itself/ where it sits as default
  - must add top, right, bottom, left attribute
  - also allows it to have z-index
  - ie. navbar project list line. Wanted to bring it higher than it was sitting. 2 ways:
      - margin bottom: 3px
      - position: relative, bottom: 3px

Position Absolute:
  - relative to it's closest parent with position relative (or absolute)
  - must add top, right, bottom, left attribute


Anchor links default to blue:
  - hyperlink goes blue
  - color: inherit; inherits font-colour from parent, versus default blue for link


letter-spacing
  - it's a thing!
